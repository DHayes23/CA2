# Software Development - Continuous Assessment 2 (Library System)

## **Introduction**
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a file-based data management system using Java. We will work in our group (Jack Curtin, Dmitry Dubrov and Denis Hayes) to create a system that stores, retrieves and manipulates data objects, making use of Java interfaces, abstract classes, regular classes, stacks, queues and/or arraylists (one or more), external files (CSV) for storage and Maven dependencies for enhanced functionality.
